    Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between
    different flowers, <br> and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly
    colored,
    conspicuous petals, attractive scents, <br> and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.

    When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may
    self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen <br> from a different flower of the same plant, but others have
    mechanisms to
    prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, <br> when pollen is transferred from the anther of one
    flower to
    the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species
